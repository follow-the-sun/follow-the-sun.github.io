# [](#header-1) Introduction

Modern day software development is spread more and more across national and international boundaries. Global software development (GSD) is now the need of the hour more than ever. One of the important concepts evolved in the past decade or so is the ``Follow the sun" (FTS) software development.

It is a model in which work from one site is handed over to another which is many time zones away (for Ex: U.S.A to India) in order for the work to be advanced while one team rests for the night. It is also known under different names such as 24 hour development or Round the clock development.   

The major benefit is the development duration or the potential in reducing the time-to-market. Theoretically speaking, if `n' sites are working on this scheme, their development speed could be increased dramatically by systematically organizing the work tasks sequentially on a daily basis and optimizing the coordination costs \[1\].

Although this seems like such an intuitive idea to work with, it is not practised widely, misunderstood often and has had a few documented industry success cases.

# [](#header-1) Background
To get a proper picture of the background on FTS, there is a need to understand a development pace and its associated concept of time to market which are the main drivers to the development of FTS. Time to market is the amount of time it takes from the moment the product is conceived until the product is available for use or sale. This is very important mainly for industries especially for the ones whose products become outdated in a very short time, for example Mobile handsets, firmwares, e-commerce systems, innovative supply chain management, etc.
 
Many factors influence the need to develop the products quickly such as avoiding contract creep, schedule slippages, budget overruns and other managerial reasons. To fulfil this need, most firms try various strategies such as overtime work, skipping steps, setting aggressive deadlines, etc which are reactive in nature. But these steps will add to the increase in cost due to burnout and fatigue \[2\]. Adding more man power to the project is not of much interest in the software development because of the wisdom gained long ago from the seminal brooks’s law ``adding manpower to a late software project makes it later” \[3\]. These difficulties prove that a systematic approach is needed in achieving a quick time-to-market strategy, which in turn leads to Follow The Sun software development scheme.
