# [](#header-1) Introduction

Modern day software development is spread more and more across national and international boundaries. Global software development (GSD) is now the need of the hour more than ever. One of the important concepts evolved in the past decade or so is the ``Follow the sun" (FTS) software development.

It is a model in which work from one site is handed over to another which is many time zones away (for Ex: U.S.A to India) in order for the work to be advanced while one team rests for the night. It is also known under different names such as 24 hour development or Round the clock development.   

The major benefit is the development duration or the potential in reducing the time-to-market. Theoretically speaking, if `n' sites are working on this scheme, their development speed could be increased dramatically by systematically organizing the work tasks sequentially on a daily basis and optimizing the coordination costs \[1\].

Although this seems like such an intuitive idea to work with, it is not practised widely, misunderstood often and has had a few documented industry success cases.

# [](#header-1) Background
To get a proper picture of the background on FTS, there is a need to understand a development pace and its associated concept of time to market which are the main drivers to the development of FTS. Time to market is the amount of time it takes from the moment the product is conceived until the product is available for use or sale. This is very important mainly for industries especially for the ones whose products become outdated in a very short time, for example Mobile handsets, firmwares, e-commerce systems, innovative supply chain management, etc.
 
Many factors influence the need to develop the products quickly such as avoiding contract creep, schedule slippages, budget overruns and other managerial reasons. To fulfil this need, most firms try various strategies such as overtime work, skipping steps, setting aggressive deadlines, etc which are reactive in nature. But these steps will add to the increase in cost due to burnout and fatigue \[2\]. Adding more man power to the project is not of much interest in the software development because of the wisdom gained long ago from the seminal brooks’s law ``adding manpower to a late software project makes it later” \[3\]. These difficulties prove that a systematic approach is needed in achieving a quick time-to-market strategy, which in turn leads to Follow The Sun software development scheme.

# [](#header-1) Principles of FTS
In order to understand and use FTS, some key principles on which FTS is based on is mentioned in this section.

*   FTS is a global software development strategy.
*   The main criteria to go for FTS is the reduction in the development time or time-to-market.
*   Production sites involved in the software development are many time zones apart.
*	There is only one site that owns the product at any point in time.
*	Project handoffs are done on a daily basis at the end of each shift.
*	The handoffs can be applied to any software development task.    
 
The above principles allow the FTS to be used in any knowledge work (not just software development). There are claims that FTS is being used at General Motors and at OfficeTiger \[4\] \[5\].  Some key assumptions in deriving the above principles are listed below:
 
1.	Each production site works during the day as ``subteam” and it needs within-site coordination.
2.	A subteam can consist of one or more members.
3.	A handoff from one site to the other can be occasionally empty due to public holidays or emergencies.
4.	There is a common product repository which allows each site to be in sink with their work at the end of each workday.

Follow the sun approach involves daily handoff of the work which suggests that there will be some reduction in the project duration. The detailed analysis needs to be done in order to understand the advantages to be gained in time. One such analysis is done using the ``calendar” time \[1\] available for production. The term calendar efficiency helps in understanding the analysis further. It is defined as the percentage of all of the calendar time (e.g., 24 * 7 = 168 hours available per week) that is used productively for work, so, a 40-hour workweek utilizes 23.8 percent of the calendar workweek, showing that there is a lot of room for calendar efficiency improvement.

Table in Fig. 1 gives the relevant facts regarding various working schemes. For example, a baseline work is 30 hrs after taking into account non-task activities. Calendar efficiency can be increased in a simple way by working overtime (overload mode), but only improves the efficiency by 6\%. Heavy overload still improves the efficiency by just 12\% but it is not an effective strategy for long time due to employee burnout. This is where FTS potential gains a lot of attention as is evident in the bottom rows of the table. An optimal FTS configuration could raise the calender efficiency as high as 71.4\%.
